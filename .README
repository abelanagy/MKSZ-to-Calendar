This script scrapes the data of a Hungarian handball match and creates a google calendar event.

This script solves a problem I had for some time, when I wanted to "import" my match dates into google calendar I had to do it manually. I thought this could be easily automated, so I made a python script, which scrapes the webpage of MKSZ and after that it uses the google api to add a new calendar event to the specified account.
